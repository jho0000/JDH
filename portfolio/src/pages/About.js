            <p>Hello and welcome! 👋</p>
            <p>I’m John Ho, an aspiring UI UX researcher in Washington fueled by visual arts and music. I love designing cool projects, and love talking to people even more! :D</p>
            <p>With a B.Sc. in Informatics focused on Human-Computer Interaction, I explore design and research processes to put into my projects and future works. I have experience conducting user research, creating design systems, and bridging design to developers in apps and design solutions.
            With my love of the Internet and technology, I am inspired to promote well-being within information systems and create quality of life changes for all.</p>

            <p>With a background in performing music and visual arts before university, I have always been interested in the complexity of human emotions and communication through art. I love drawing, music, and psychology, which lead to my passion in the UI UX field.</p>
            <p>I also love video games, cooking, and diving into Internet subcultures. In my free time I am reading self-help books and manga, walking my two dogs, and learning new recipes in the kitchen -- all while listening to music.</p>
