                        <h1>Project Summary</h1>
                            <p>In a Value Sensitive Design (VSD) course, our team developed an equitable and inclusive academic and career support solution for undergraduate university students. Using <a class="link" href="https://vsdesign.org/vsd/#Method" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSD methodologies</a>, we centered our design process on student input and key values across stakeholders to create an equitable web application.</p>
                            <p>This involved synthesising insights from surveys, conducting structured interviews, and crafting a high-fidelity Figma prototype. The VSD investigations also included many types of stakeholder and value analysis, in addition to a coding manual to guide our design work.</p>
                            <p>Our webpage prototype, integrating the VSD tripartite framework, seeks to establish a value-driven platform where students connect with specialised degree and career support services whilst empowering all stakeholder values.</p>

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>It is crucial that postsecondary education can afford all students, regardless of their background and life responsibilities, and the opportunity to pursue their educational interests and receive the necessary guidance and support they require to succeed. There is no <b>one-size-fits-all criteria</b> that students have to fulfill in further education, but schools and institutions aim to ensure that all students <b>feel valued and supported</b> throughout their experiences.</p>

            <div class="research">
                <h1>Literary Research</h1>
                <p>With diverse and unique student populations, institutional practices can be well-meaning but ineffective due to a lack of equitable support and access, especially for students from underserved and marginalised communities.</p>
                <p>Underrepresented students, among others, may encounter significant barriers in accessing academic and career resources:</p>
                <img class="asset" src="/img/Scoolwise/Research.png" alt="Literary research insights"></img>
                <p>The intricacies of institutional enrollment processes and support systems contribute to a lack of transparency and specificity for undergraduates, resulting in increased anxiety and reduced self-efficacy among students. In essence, there is a pressing need to empower student voices within the support process, drawing attention to individual student needs and enhancing relationships.</p>
                <p>These initial insights lead to our problem statement:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hmw-statement">
                <h2>How might we <span class="green">create a design solution with VSD</span> that <span class="blue">empowers undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds</span> to <span class="purple">ensure exploration and progress towards further education and career readiness</span>?</h2>

            <div class="design-process">
                <h1>Design Process</h1>
                    <p>Drawing attention on addressing equity gaps in degree and career support, we recognized that our primary goal was to connect students with specialised degree and career support resources. This connection would facilitate more inclusive, equity-centered, and successful educational and post-educational experiences.</p>
                    <p>The following sections go through our investigations towards our equity-centered career and degree support web application. All visualisations and references can be seen on the project’s <a class="link" href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPmtqsE0=/?share_link_id=786805616608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miro board</a> and in our <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uzMRgFDW779csVB-afBExIdEgSxsqZgEqEwUxHVN6kE/edit#heading=h.5z36j5h2e9nu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report’s appendix</a>.</p>
                <h2>Conceptual Investigation</h2>
                    <p>Postsecondary education serves a purpose of providing a growth-centered environment where students can pursue their educational interests and goals in a supportive manner, enriching their life experiences. We have categorised success metrics for undergraduates as either tangible and structured, or abstract and holistic qualities:</p>
                    <img class="asset" src="/img/Scoolwise/Success.png" alt="Tangible and abstract success in higher education"></img>
                    <p>Next, a stakeholder analysis illustrates a broad network of direct and indirect stakeholders that would be involved in a design solution for undergraduate students.</p>
                    <p>Direct stakeholders, including student advisors, counsellors, alumni, and industry professionals, impact students by offering support through <b>mentorship</b> and <b>guidance</b>, providing resources and fostering valuable <b>social connections</b>.</p>
                    <p>Indirect stakeholders, such as educators, employers, and friends/family of students, find satisfaction in <b>students’ success</b> in further education and nurturing them <b>within diverse environments</b>.</p>
                    <p>With a focus on the selected stakeholders of undergraduate students, university advisors, industry professionals, and friends and family, we conducted value sources for our project:</p>
                    <img class="asset" src="/img/Scoolwise/ValueAnalysis.png" alt="Value source analysis"></img>
                    <p>Our investigations enabled the team to identify four key values that would ensure key stakeholder benefits, such as students’ greater confidence in a career path. This also minimises value tensions and harms for our stakeholders, such as balancing responsibilities between parties and reducing stress behind added pressure with succeeding in higher education.</p>
                    <img class="asset" src="/img/Scoolwise/KeyValues.png" alt="Key values: student success, mentorship, balance, and equity"></img>
                <h2>Empirical Investigation</h2> 
                    <p>Our empirical investigation followed a four-stage process to synthesise insights from students regarding their preferences for an equitable resource and support solution for undergraduates:</p>
                    <img class="asset" src="/img/Scoolwise/Empirical.png" alt="Empirical investigation stages"></img>
                    <p>Distributed via Google Forms, our <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cIe7kUNNHljt2vnPsHRby9Uy_cQ0ZRu7296b1KK0s34/edit#heading=h.2u0p13jjxmcd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> invited university students to reflect on their education and career path experiences, seeking their input on various areas including institutional advising, support resources and quality, and industry preparation.</p>
                    <p>With 23 survey respondents, our key insights were as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>40%</b> of students reported not receiving holistic and equitable degree support through institutional advising.</li>
                        <li><b>50%</b> of students do not perceive university career support as equitable or empowering.</li>
                        <li><b>60%</b> of students expressed feeling unprepared to transition out of university to industry work</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, <b>30%</b> of students indicated that they had not been provided equitable support from advisors while pursuing their college degrees, with an equal percentage struggling to connect with mentors related to their career interests.</p>
                    <img class="asset-caption" src="/img/Scoolwise/Question.png" alt="Sample question shows 40% of students do not feel secure in identifying a career path"></img>
                    <p class="caption">Sample question showing 40% of students responding they do not feel secure in identifying a career path</p>
                    <p>Most students shared positive experiences with advising sessions, networking within their majors, and feeling included in terms of their identifying factors (e.g. race, ethnicity, gender identity, etc.). However, there is room for improvement in addressing specific concerns, such as finance-related stress and helping students achieve life balance.</p>
                    
                    <p>Survey respondents commonly described navigating their educational and career paths as <b>stressful</b>, <b>confusing</b>, and <b>challenging</b>. Overall, there was a slight disconnect in equitable degree, career, and mentorship support, which could better guide students for industry preparation and self-efficacy.</p>
                    <img class="asset-caption" src="/img/Scoolwise/Question2.png" alt="Sample question shows efficacy and guidance are two student-perceived values of advisors"></img>
                    <p class="caption">Efficacy and guidance are two student-perceived values of advisors, how do we emphasise these in advising-related connections for students?</p>
                    <p>To expand upon survey insights, we conducted Zoom interviews with <b>six participants</b> representing diverse racial, financial, and educational backgrounds, using a participatory approach. Each team member conducted an <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cIe7kUNNHljt2vnPsHRby9Uy_cQ0ZRu7296b1KK0s34/edit#heading=h.4lqp25cx7kth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> to explore the nuances of how students identified their degree-related issues and potential career interests.</p>
                    <p>Annotations and a coding manual were produced through Dovetail to provide a comprehensive overview of qualitative insights. Students highlighted several value codes that emphasised areas of improvements for a clearer academic and career path within higher education:</p>

                <h2>Technical Investigation</h2>
                    <p>Knowing the critical high-level objectives in our project, our team brainstormed prioritised features within the envisioned web application. These features were designed to offer course, degree, and career recommendations, facilitated by social support connections and specialised mentorship.</p>
                    <p>Using <a class="link" href="https://www.envisioningcards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSD Envisioning Cards</a>, our product aimed to empower underserved students within the educational system while providing autonomy and guidance to all potential users. We recognized the importance of ensuring that the product met the needs of all stakeholders, being a viable solution for widespread usage across institutions and companies.</p>

                <h1>Our Deliverable</h1>
                <p>At its core, our product offers specialised course and degree recommendations by enabling users to create personalised and dynamic degree paths tailored to their unique interests and goals, which institutions can implement for their students. The primary features of our web application were derived from the key insights gathered from students in our previous investigations:</p>
                <img class="asset" src="/img/Scoolwise/Features.png" alt="Scoolwise key features"></img>
                <p>Our dashboard is user-centric with clear navigation and information hierarchy, displaying all available services for students to choose from. Our navigation sidebar and widgets contain icons, imagery, and call of action to help direct users across the web application.</p>
                <img class="asset-caption" src="/img/Scoolwise/Dashboard.png" alt="Home dashboard page"></img>
                <p class="caption">Home dashboard page</p>
                <p>The Interest Evaluation tab has a landing page where students can begin an interest survey, see an overview from their most recently completed survey, and refer to all previously completed surveys. Documenting results gives personalisation towards  unique academic and career interests, ensuring student success with their engagement.</p>
                <img class="asset-caption" src="/img/Scoolwise/Interests.png" alt="Interest Evaluation pages"></img>
                <p class="caption">Interest Evaluation pages</p>
                <p>Included in the Interests tab is the survey page, a guided questionnaire to gauge personal interests and characteristics to suggest potential university courses, applicable degree programs, and relevant career paths. This helps promote exploration and a growth mindset, in addition to having imagery and a progress bar to keep survey retention for equitable recommendations.</p>
                <img class="asset-caption" src="/img/Scoolwise/Survey.png" alt="Survey introduction and sample question pages"></img>
                <p class="caption">Survey introduction and sample question</p>
                <p>Our Degree Support page allows students to build guided and dynamic degree paths through interactive drag-and-drop components on the interface. From here, recommended courses from interests and related degrees can be assembled together for a program.</p>
                <img class="asset-caption" src="/img/Scoolwise/DegreeSupport.png" alt="Degree support and course builder"></img>
                <p class="caption">Degree support and course builder</p>
                <p>The survey results page serves as a central hub of information for students to receive specialised support and bridge gaps in academic and career guidance. Survey responses are organised into three main sections: recommended courses at a selected institution, related degree programs with convenient links to application materials and department advisors, and potential career paths that align with suggested programs and courses.</p>
                <img class="asset-caption" src="/img/Scoolwise/Results1.png" alt="Survey results page"></img>
                <p class="caption">Compiled results for recommended courses, programs, and mentors all together</p>

            <div class="takeaways">
                <h1>Takeaways</h1>
                <p>Given the time constraints of making <i>Scoolwise</i>, we would have liked to have a larger number of survey respondents and cover more underrepresented demographics for our interviews (e.g. Black, non-binary) for further inclusivity and a comprehensive outlook of pain points. Recognising these limitations drove us to post our survey in specific online communities (e.g. subreddits) to reach underrepresented demographics, but moving forward with our research had us indicate that we did not have an ideal large enough pool of surveyees from these demographics.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, some key lessons from this project include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Adding clarity in survey and interview questions</b> and using definitive language on our prototype.</li>
                    <li><b>Referencing qualitative insights</b> through common themes and notes in user research findings.</li>
                    <li><b>Aligning stakeholder values</b> from direct conversations and feedback involved in the design process.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>Scoolwise</i> demonstrated a thorough research and design journey to achieve equitable academic and career support for all undergraduate students, employing VSD design methods and methodologies. The tripartite process contributed to the web application's direction, with primary stakeholder involvement ensuring student success and complementing the diverse needs of underrepresented undergraduate students.</p>
